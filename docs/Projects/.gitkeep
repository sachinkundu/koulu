# Projects

This folder contains implementation tracking for features being built.

## What Goes Here

- Feature folders containing:
  - Implementation-Plan.md — Phase-based build plan
  - Phase-X-Summary.md — Summary of each completed phase
  - Team-Update.md (optional) — Current status

## Creating a New Project Folder

1. Create a folder with the feature name: `[Feature Name]/`
2. Add the Implementation-Plan.md after Phase 2
3. Add Phase-X-Summary.md files as you complete each phase in Phase 3
